      <title>New Logo and Website</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to our new project website! Finally the old paint is gone and a new state of art modern look is here.</p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<p>The website has been overhauled due to popular demand. <strong>We really needed a refresh.</strong>
In that process upfront I decided to go for a <em>full rebranding of the project</em>, too.</p>
<p>Looking at the results I think it was worth the wait. The new colorful isometric logo that relates to the letters <em>&quot;L&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;i&quot;</em> alongside the flow of colors which symbolizes the &quot;flow of communication and related components&quot; should hopefully hit the spot of what the project stands for.</p>
<p><img src="/images/thumbs/512/img/brand/brand-ontop-gradient-alpha.png" alt="libimobiledevice logo" title="The new logo and font" width="512" loading="lazy" /></p>
<p>The next milestone is to integrate this page to be hosted using <a href="https://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>.
This should allow contributions for all content by the community!
Looks like we arrived in the <em>&quot;static website generator era&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>I really hope you guys enjoy the effort and there is much more coming in the next weeks!</p>
<p><small>P.S.: Just want to congratulate <a href="https://inkscape.org">Inkscape to their fantastic 1.0 release</a>. That helped all the way in our process so, &quot;All your base are belong to us&quot;!</small></p>]]></description>
