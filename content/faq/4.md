The library has shown to be compatible with firmware releases going back to the 1.x series up to todays without issues. At rare times, bugs introduced by the firmware had to be worked around with simple fixes but nothing major prevented it from working. Thus in effect, the implementation proves very stable and compatible among firmware releases.
