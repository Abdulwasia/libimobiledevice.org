To test if you installed everything correctly plug in your device and run "ideviceinfo" within a terminal. Congratulations if it prints a lot of details about your device. Feel free to checkout [the documentation]({{ site.urls.docs }}/libimobiledevice/latest/) or dive into [the source code](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice/).
